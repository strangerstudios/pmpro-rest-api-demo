Sample code to demonstration use of the PMPro REST API endpoints.

== Description ==

This plugin is a demo of the WP REST API endpoints added by Paid Memberships Pro.

== Authorization ==

To use the WP REST API, you need to create a way to make authorized calls against the API. Our recommended approach for this is to use the [Application Passwords](https://wordpress.org/plugins/application-passwords/) plugin.
